Accomplishments:
1. Installed Jenkins and familiarized ourselves with how it interfaces with Maven projects.
2. Set up build environment, source control, and debugging environment for Jenkins plugins
3. Tested an exmaple Jenkins plugin
4. Created a plugin that modifies the pom.xml of a Maven project when enabled in order to turn on Ekstazi.  The Ekstazi plugin is automatically pulled from the maven repo.

Our plugin is in our SVN repo.  See the Readme.md for how to use it.  It is a bit buggy right now (see comment 3 below).

Next steps:
1. Code cleanup and better exception handling
2. Running the plugin multiple times in a row leads to multiple Ekstazi entires in it (fix this...already know how)
3. Add drop down to plugin in order to select Ekstazi version numbers (already know how)
4. Implement the collection of historical data from Ekstazi runs (needs research)
5. Research versioning of the myExcludes file.
